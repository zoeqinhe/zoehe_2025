    "- How it aligns with coding: aspects of psychology and sociology can align with that of coding because of the similarities with human interactions. When creating a program or a website intended for public use, it is important for it to be interactive and user-friendly. This can be achieved by applying studies and patterns learned from psychology into computer systems and coding to help these programs become more efficient, engaging, and beneficial. \n",
