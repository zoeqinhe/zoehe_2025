    "## Final Reflection\n",
    "- Computer science is something that I struggled with throughout the course of trimester 1 and trimester 2. However, I believe that I improved as a coder in trimester 3 where I felt more comfortable and confident in my ability to create a website. Before, I had felt unsure about coding and couldn't make meaningful contributions to the overall group project, but in our Pilot City project, I stopped trying to worry about all of the \"technical things\" and instead focused on learning through the experience of creating a feature. Overall, I feel that APCSP has not just improved my knowledge and understanding of coding, but it has also allowed me to become more adaptive and persistent when it comes to facing challenges in coding and helped me develop better problem-solving skills."
